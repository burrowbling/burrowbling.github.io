    <p>A year is very long and also not very long. Recency bias probably skews lots of these works to the later end of the year, but my recent arrival at an art and design school has influenced me to care more actively about artworks and art, seeking them out more. These ten were the ones that I thought influneced me greatly and I think of frequently when making my own artwork. </p>
    <p>Here are a second set of ten artworks I really loved from the year. Thanks for reading.</p>
