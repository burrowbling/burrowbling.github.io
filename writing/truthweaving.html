    <h2>Truthweaving</h2>
    <p><em>Dec 28 2025</em></p>

<p> 
On a clear silver night I would like to look and see something true, I would like the truth.   
</p> <p> 
One tenth a degree, skyward glory, facing under palms or pines I do not mind, I would like the truth.
</p> <p> 
I would like something to believe in, nonmessianical and adfree. I am looking for something flowertouching waterbearing silencefearing people had, though I'm beginning to suspect they never found it.  I would like the truth.
</p> <p> 
I would like to dance, be grabbed, wrapped. I would like to wring silver stone bells on mountaintops, to rid my teeth of grime, to get as close to the moon as possible forgoing any ringtone of fingerwritten wealthy energy! I would like big romance and big cherry trees rolled five feet by fifteen, rhymed in and out of order, I would like these things to get closer to magic. I want the truth!
</p> <p> 
If I snipped every firecable and dreamt dessert for a hundred years, could I? I mean, seventy thousand feet through and I can't tell a cloud from cotton I want the truth.
</p> <p> 
I'm scared of things passing fast, because I know things do. I'm worried, worried things will rot off the vine and bridges will crumble and I won't have soaked up every ounce of world I've been overdoubly astonishingly unbelievably precariously dealt! I'm unsure, how far can I push these limits, how many tines can I break, how many ferns can I pull apart like whispers, how many stones can I mirror like memories?
</p> <p> 
Stars spin like seasons, fast and wet and tired and godlike. Maybe the truth is sunpeeking and radiograsping every now and then, pinecones and preserves and heirlooms and swingsets all the way down. Maybe it's drinking all the moonlight you get and letting cold winds dry seawater off your lips. If you really press me, I'll guess it's midnight shadowdriving and long teas poured over nights. These truths flow fast round bodies and sprinkle past our shoelaces, landing later or never, gripped for maybe a millisecond. 
</p> <p> 
Maybe the truth is searching for one, and having a good time doing it. Maybe it's dropping meaning down doorways and ringing down elevator shafts, jumping to see what lands. Letting go of fire and wine, planting yourself in the mud and opening your mouth. 
</p> <p> 
I would like the truth. I will partake and believe and plant myself very deep into mud and drink up the world and love gold and fear gold and have a good time doing it. I have stones to ground me and leaves to carry me and fires to build. I think i'll take my stonegrounded leafcarrying firebuilding hypermomentary nonscheduled overprescribed life up off the ground and run. That's the truth anyways, isn't it?
